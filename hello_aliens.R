cat("Hi there, you aliens. I wonder what you worry about, and what you deal with on a daily basis -- today I am dealing with homework. Homework is a set of tasks you're assigned in order to prove your learning, and proving your learning allows you credentials, which allow you to be chosen to do more tasks, which allows you to earn money, which allows you to eat. This is called capitalism and meritocracy. I wonder how your way of life works. I cannot even imagine a system of living where you do not earn that which you need, or in which your time and personality strengths are not commodified. But perhaps this is all pretentious, because it's possible that your lives are exactly like ours. I suppose I will have to wait for your reply to find out if you have iphones, too.")
